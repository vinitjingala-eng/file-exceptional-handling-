        "**1.   What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Compiled languages translate all source code to machine code (an executable file) before running, making them faster but requiring a platform-specific build; interpreted languages translate and execute code line-by-line during runtime using an interpreter, offering easier debugging and portability but slower execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.  What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to manage runtime errors (exceptions) and prevent a program from crashing unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to guarantee that cleanup code runs, regardless of whether an exception occurs or is caught, ensuring resources like file handles or database connections are always closed, memory freed, or other essential finalizations completed, preventing resource leaks and making programs more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.  What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Logging in Python is the process of recording events and messages during a program's execution to provide crucial runtime information for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Its primary significance is to define cleanup actions that should be performed just before an object is destroyed by the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6.  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  import module:\n",
        "\n",
        "     What it does: Imports the entire module and binds the module object to a name (usually the module's name) in the current namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "     How to use: You must use the dot notation (module_name.function_name()) to access its functions, classes, or variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "     from module import ...\n",
        "\n",
        "     What it does: Imports specific items (functions, classes, or variables) from a module directly into the current namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "     How to use: You can use the imported items directly without prefixing them with the module name (function_name())\n",
        "\n",
        "**7.   How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using a single try block and employing one of several methods, including a tuple of exceptions in one except clause, multiple except clauses, or catching a parent exception class. As of Python 3.11, you can also use except* for ExceptionGroup objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The purpose of the with statement in Python, when handling files, is to ensure automatic and safe resource management by guaranteeing the file is closed properly after its use, even if errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9.   What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Definition: Executes multiple threads within a single process, sharing resources like memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Memory: Threads share the same memory space, making communication easier but introducing race conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Overhead: Lower than multiprocessing because threads are lightweight and share resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Multiprocessing:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Definition: Executes multiple processes simultaneously, using different CPUs or cores for each process.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Memory: Each process has its own separate memory space, providing isolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Overhead: Higher due to creating and managing separate processes and their memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10.  What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Using the logging module in Python provides a powerful and flexible framework for tracking events, which offers significant advantages over simple print() statements for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**11.  What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Memory management in Python is an automatic process that handles the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12.  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python are using try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage potential errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13.   Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Memory management is important in Python because it enables the creation of fast, stable, and memory-efficient applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14.   What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The Role of try and except:\n",
        "\n",
        "     try block:\n",
        "  \n",
        "     The try block contains the code that might potentially raise an exception. If an exception occurs within this block, the remaining code in the try block is skipped, and the program flow is transferred to the associated except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "     except block:\n",
        "     \n",
        "      The except block defines how to respond to an exception if one occurs in the try block. You can specify the type of exception it should catch. If the except block catches the specified exception, the code inside the except block is executed.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Python's garbage collection system is an automatic memory management process that uses a combination of reference counting and a generational garbage collector to reclaim memory from unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The else block in exception handling allows a programmer to specify a block of code that should be executed only if the code in the corresponding try block runs to completion without any exceptions being raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The common logging levels in Python, from least to most severe, are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The multiprocessing module is a high-level, cross-platform abstraction for parallel processing, whereas os.fork() is a low-level, Unix-only system call for creating a new process. The multiprocessing module uses os.fork() (or similar mechanisms) internally on Unix systems but provides a safer, more robust framework for managing processes and sharing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Closing a file in Python is crucial because it releases system resources, ensures data integrity, and prevents unexpected errors in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20.   What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The primary difference is that file.read() reads the entire file into a single string, while file.readline() reads only a single line at a time. This makes readline() more memory-efficient for very large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The Python logging module is a built-in, flexible, and powerful framework for tracking events that occur while software runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22.  What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  The Python os module is used for interacting with the operating system to perform file and directory management tasks in a portable way. It provides functions that act as a bridge between your Python program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Python's memory management challenges stem from its automatic nature, primarily memory leaks (especially with circular references), the overhead of garbage collection, inefficient data structure choices leading to memory bloat, and limited developer control over the private heap.\n",
        "\n",
        "**24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  In Python, you manually raise an exception using the raise keyword, followed by an instance of an exception class and an optional, informative error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It's crucial to use multithreading in applications for better responsiveness, preventing freezes during heavy tasks (like downloads) by running UIs on separate threads, and improved performance by utilizing multi-core CPUs for parallel processing.\n",
